# Handlebars setup
********** WIP **************  
Experimenting with a simple to setup Handlebars development environment...
Currently this is working with one caveats:  
The gulp task builds everything as well as the JSON and then watches for changes but
- The JSON is watched but the changes are not updated until you restart the gulp task


## Running the demo

Clone this repo and run `yarn start`  
This will install all of the dependencies and start a local server.
